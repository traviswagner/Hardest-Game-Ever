# Hardest-Game-Ever
I have already coded the game, but now I have to 1. Make the Game Move Faster.  2. Make the "Game Piece" not a red square (w/ an image)  3. Make the "obstacles" not a green rectangle (an image)  BONUS: make the game speed up when the player reaches a certain score.  BONUS2: Make the game use keyboard keys instead of buttons.
